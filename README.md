# Checksum Wizard

**Checksum Wizard** is an industrial-grade file checksum utility for generating, validating, and comparing file checksums using a wide range of cryptographic hash algorithms.

It offers robust error handling, support for multiple hashing algorithms, and a command-line interface designed for security-conscious environments.

## üîç Features

- Supports industry-standard and modern hash algorithms (SHA2, SHA3, BLAKE2, etc.)
- Warns about usage of weak or deprecated algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1)
- Validates file integrity using expected checksum values
- Compares two files for identical hash output
- Outputs in human-readable and JSON formats
- CLI with support for scripting and automation
- Handles interruptions gracefully

## üõ† Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. make the script executable
```
chmod +x checksum.py
```

Requires **Python 3.10+**.

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python checksum.py <mode> <file> [options]
```

### Modes

* `generate`: Generate checksums for a file
* `validate`: Validate a file against a known checksum
* `compare`: Compare two files using the same algorithm

### Options

| Option         | Description                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--algorithm`  | Hash algorithm for validation/compare (default: `sha256`) |
| `--algorithms` | Hash algorithms for generation (default: `sha256 sha512`) |
| `--checksum`   | Expected checksum value (required for `validate` mode)    |
| `--other-file` | Second file path (required for `compare` mode)            |
| `--output`     | Save result as JSON to file                               |
| `--no-warn`    | Suppress security warnings about weak algorithms          |

### Examples

#### Generate SHA256 and SHA512 checksums

```bash
python checksum.py generate myfile.txt --algorithms sha256 sha512
```

#### Validate a file with SHA256

```bash
python checksum.py validate myfile.txt --algorithm sha256 --checksum <expected_hash>
```

#### Compare two files with SHA3-256

```bash
python checksum.py compare file1.txt --other-file file2.txt --algorithm sha3_256
```

#### Save output to JSON

```bash
python checksum.py generate myfile.txt --output results.json
```
